KeePass Enhanced Entry View is built using Visual Studio 2010 on Windows.

It may or may not build under other environments, I don't know.

Build Environment
-----------------

To set up the build environment, download the following dependencies:

KeePass 2.21
 Download http://downloads.sourceforge.net/keepass/KeePass-2.21.zip
 Extract contents to the "KeePass-2.21" folder

KeePass 2.21 Source
 Download http://downloads.sourceforge.net/keepass/KeePass-2.21-Source.zip
 Extract contents to the "KeePass-2.21-Source" folder

ObjectListView Source
 Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview/2.6.0/ObjectListView-2.6.0.zip/download
 Extract contents to the "ThirdPartyAssemblies" folder
 

Building
--------

When building the solution, under Debug configuration KeePass is referenced as a project,
to assist with debugging and source navigation. The build outputs will be placed in the
plugins folder for the KeePass built from source, and that KeePass executed.

Under Release configuration, KeePass is referenced as a binary, from the KeePass.exe in
the KeePass-2.21 folder. This ensures a correct strong-named dependency. The build outputs
will be placed in the Releases folder, ready for publication.
